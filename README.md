# Notes
These programs can be run using python on a Raspberry Pi Computer. 

In order to run them you need a few things:
- Of course the right hardware must be connected to your Pi. Sense hat, or EnviroPhat
- I2C support must be enabled in the Raspberry Pi kernel ( see the program rpi-config)
- For the Pimoroni EnviroPhat, you have to install the software for it
